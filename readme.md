# ATL Server 2020?!

Yes indeed. It all started very innocently. I was experimenting with cl /kernel switch. And then I wondered into my own code from pre 1998 (gasp!). Little I know it never worketh...

That was 24 hours ago. Which I spent refactoring, and making it work. It *seems* to work now. There is also a cpp client. `comdef.h` and the rest. 

Still work in progress. But I am hopeful :)
